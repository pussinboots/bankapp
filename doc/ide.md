##Integrated Development Environment (aka ide)

I used Eclipse for java development for couple of years than i start to use IntelliJ Idea for Scala/Groovy.
And now i start to use [sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) text editor with some plugins. 

I loved the code reefactoring and search stuff from Eclipse and Idea but afte some experience with 
Scala and Javascript development with nodejs and angularjs i prefer speed and i always use the console
for software builds with ant, maven, sbt, npm, bower, ...  and so at the end i only need a quick and fast
text editor with some autocompletion (but fast autocompletion like in sublime but of course no full autocompletion 
support for scala or existing functions and methods). So if i start with a new scala framework maybe than i will
use Idea to get knowlegde about the class structure and methods but if i feel familiar with it than i will use
sublime and seach for source code if i need to know which class and which method.

Problem with Scala and ide is that things become slow. Good combination is a text editor and play console with
```bash
play ~test
or
play ~test-only *SomeSpec
```
I feel that this is faster than scala compilation in ide.

####Play 2 and angularjs

For a project that frontend code is writen in javascript (angularjs) where i can debug it directly in the browser and try also things out at the console than for the rest backend code i don't need a full ide anymore.

####IDE battle

I still prefer the IntelliJ Idea over Eclipse it is better structured and easier to combine steps like git commit and push for example. But for a beginner of programming i think eclipse is easier to learn for idea you have to get comftable with the idears behind the features it offer. Than i think you could be more productive with idea.

But at the end everyone has to choice it for her or his own.
